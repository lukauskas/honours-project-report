\chapter{Background and Introduction}

The complete set of information required to create and maintain cells of a
living organism is contained in the genome of the organism. In humans, this
information is encoded in a long chain of nucleotides within the DNA molecules
in 23 different chromosomes located in the nucleus of every cell as well as in
a small segment of DNA located within the mitochondrion of the cell.  
These chains of nucleotides can be sequenced by determining the order of appearance
of the four bases within the genome: adenine (often abbreviated as simply "A"), cytosine (abbreviated as C),
guanine (G) or thymine (T).
The sequence of these nucleobases is commonly referred to as the DNA Sequence. 

\section{Structure of  DNA}
Generally DNA molecules are observed in pairs of two tightly connected
molecules, rather than as a single molecule. These molecules are known as
strands and are held together by the bonds between the nucleobases: guanine is
known to form a bond with cytosine, whereas adenine forms a bond with thymine.
Since each kind of nucleobase can form a bond with only one other kind of
nucleobase, both of the DNA strands contain enough information to recreate the
other on its own. This redundancy is required for DNA replication process. 

Because of this redundancy, the sequences on complimentary strands are often considered at the
same time as sequences of base pairs, rather than sequences of nucleotides. The
human sex cells are known to contain around three billion such base pairs.

\section{Next-Generation Sequencing}
The Human Genome Project was the research project that has sequenced all
three billion of these base pairs for the first time. The project was estimated
to cost 3 billion dollars for American tax payers and last 15 years, but has ended up
costing a bit less than that - \$2.7 billion and was completed in 13
years\footnote{See \url{http://www.genome.gov/11006943} and
    \url{http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/about.shtml}
    for more information}. 
    
 Since then, a variety of DNA sequencing methods were
developed that reduce both the time and cost required to perform sequencing
significantly\citep{Shendure:2008uc,Liu:2012ve}. New technology and reduced
costs of DNA Sequencing has made it more accessible and allowed
development of new genome-scale analysis methods such as ChIP-Sequencing
(ChIP-Seq).

Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is the corner stone of the methods implemented in this project. This algorithm was initially developed in the speech recognition community in order to allow accurate comparisons between words spoken with tempo variations. 
This comparison is achieved by warping the time axis nonlinearly. That is, the axis is stretched or compressed as to minimise the total distance between the points aligned to each other. The stretching and compressing is done by creating an alignment between the two sequences, also known as the warping path, almost arbitrarily, with a few constraints described below. The distances between aligned points are then computed and summed to obtain what is commonly referred to as DTW Distance.

More formally, given two sequences $\mathbf{a} = a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and $\mathbf{b} = b_1, b_2, ..., b_m$, Dynamic Time Warping aims to construct a warping path $\mathbf{p} = { (p_{1,0}, p_{1,1}), (p_{2,0}, p_{2,1}), ..., (p_{k,0}, p_{k, 1}) }$ that maps each point on the first sequence, specified as $p_{i,0}$ to a point on the second sequence, $p_{i,1}$ such that the following three constraints hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{Boundary Condition}: The path must start at the first point of sequence $\mathbf{a}$ and this point must be mapped to the first point of the second sequence: $p_1 = (1,1)$. Similarly, the final points of both sequences should be mapped to each other, and the path must end there: $p_k = (m, n).$ 
\item \emph{Monotonicity Condition}: The path must not move \emph{back in time}: 
    $p_{1,i} \le p_{2,i} \le p_{3,i} \le ... \le p_{k, i}$ for both $i=0$ and $i=1$.
\item \emph{Step Size Condition}: At each step the path must either map the same point on one sequence to the next point on another sequence, or map next points on both sequences together, mathematically:
    $p_{i+1} - p_{i} \in \{(0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\}$ for all $i < k$.
\end{enumerate}

Furthermore, we are only interested in a warping that is minimal, given some distance measure $d$ that would compute the distances between aligned points (e.g. Euclidean distance): $\hat{P} = \argmin_P \sum_{(i,j) \in P} d(a_i, b_j)$. Such minimal warping alignment can be computed in $O(nm)$ time by applying dynamic programming techniques. We construct a $n \times m$ matrix $\mathbf{D}$ where each entry $D_{i,j}$ will contain a minimal (warped) distance of matching first $i$ components of the first sequence, $a_1..a_i$, to first $j$ elements of the second sequence, $b_1..b_j$. The first component of the matrix, $D_{1,1}$ is initialised to the distance between the first components of the two sequences, $d(a_1, b_1)$ as specified by the boundary condition.

The matrix is then filled row by row, according to the following recursive equation:
$$D_{i,j} = d(a_i, b_j) + min(D_{i-1, j}, D_{i, j-1}, D_{i,j})$$

In the end, the column $D_{n,m}$ holds the minimal warped distance between two series.
If the minimal warping path is needed, it can be traced back by following the recursive relation backwards from $D_{i,j}$. Please refer to \citep{Muller:2007bo} for more details on the workings of DTW.

To illustrate what DTW does, have a look at the \autoref{fig:DTW:alignments}. The two sequences in the figure are sine and cosine plotted over the range $[-\pi; \pi)$. Given the nature of these functions, we know that the shapes in the two sequences are essentially identical, just shifted by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians, therefore we should get a good alignment of them by some warping of the x axis that is used as the time axis in this sense.

In \autoref{fig:DTW:euclidean_alignment}, each point on the sequence A is aligned to corresponding point on the sequence B. If we were to sum the distances between aligned points, we would get the Euclidean distance between these two sequences. We can see that these sequences will likely not be labelled as similar, because the distance between mapped points is always large. The mapping seen in \autoref{fig:DTW:dtw_alignment}, on the other hand is able to correct for the shift in the X axis. 
The highest points are now mapped to each other, so are the other points that are in the patterns existing in both of the sequences. If we were to calculate the differences between the mapped points again, we would see that the resulting distance is much smaller than Euclidean one and the two sequences will likely be considered close, yet not identical, as there still are features in the sequence A that are not in the sequence B, for instance, the valley in the beginning, therefore resulting in a costly mapping between the two.
