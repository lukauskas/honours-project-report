At least eight different classes have been characterized to date and many different sites have been identified for each class. Operationally, modifications function either by disrupting chromatin contacts or by affecting the recruitment of nonhistone proteins to chromatin. Their presence on histones can dictate the higher-order chromatin structure in which DNA is packaged and can orchestrate the ordered recruitment of enzyme complexes to manipulate DNA. In this way, histone modifications have the potential to influence many fundamental biological processes, some of which may be epigenetically inherited.},

It has many advantages over other conversational methods such as simplicity and good generalization ability. At the same time, the generalization ability of an ensemble could be significantly better than that of a single learner. In this paper, we intend to improve the performance of the speaker recognition system by introducing a novel method combining optimizing annular region-weighted distance k nearest neighbor with BagWithProb ensemble learning schemes. Experiments studied in this paper indicate that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of speaker identification system.

A sensitivity analysis of the various schemes to estimation errors is carried out to show that this finding can be justified theoretically
